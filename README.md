🌸 IRIS Flower Classification – Data Science Project

📌 Project Goal: Apply data science techniques to analyze and classify the Iris flower species using machine learning algorithms.

🧠 What I Learned:

Data Cleaning and Preparation

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Feature Selection and Visualization

Classification using ML models (e.g., Logistic Regression, KNN, etc.)

Model Evaluation and Accuracy Scoring


📊 Tools & Libraries Used:
Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn

🔍 This project was part of my CodSoft Data Science Internship (20 June – 20 July 2025), where I developed hands-on experience with real-world datasets.
